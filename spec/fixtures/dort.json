        "In 1817, in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, Turner visited the Netherlands for the first time. He spent just a day and a half in Dordrecht (known locally as Dort), making numerous pencil sketches, and exhibited this luminous view of the city from the north at the Royal Academy in 1818. Turner, who often indulged in playful rivalry with his fellow artists, may have been stimulated by Augustus Wall Callcott’s homage to the Dutch Old Masters, “The Pool of London” (Bowood Settlement, Wiltshire), exhibited to acclaim at the Royal Academy in 1816. Described by the “Morning Chronicle” in May 1818 as “one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited,” Dort was immediately acquired by Turner's patron Walter Fawkes. The price was five hundred guineas, a huge sum, though as James Hamilton has recently noted, it is likely that Turner was never paid, since Fawkes was in chronic debt, and Turner had himself lent him three thousand pounds (Hamilton, 2001). The painting hung in the Drawing Room at Farnley Hall until 1966, when it was purchased by Paul Mellon.\\n\\n Although Turner did not visit the Netherlands until he was over forty, he was familiar with important Dutch Old Master paintings in British collections from early in his career, and his first Royal Academy submission, Fishermen at Sea (Tate, London), testifies to his admiration for Rembrandt. Dort pays tribute to one of Turner’s most formative Dutch influences, Aelbert Cuyp; the motif of the packet boat is directly borrowed from Cuyp’s Maas at Dordrecht (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1815. Dort is as much a personal artistic statement as an homage to an Old Master, however; its contrast of cool and warm colors and bright chromatic scale (a contemporary viewer told the diarist Joseph Farington that “it almost puts your eyes out” [Farington, “Diary”, vol. 15, p. 5191]) mark the emergence of Turner the colorist and anticipate the brilliance of his work of the 1820s.\\n\\n Gillian Forrester\\n\\n John Baskett, Paul Mellon's legacy, a passion for British art: masterpieces from the Yale Center for British Art, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, CT, 2007, pp. 30,33,284-85, no. 90, N5220 M552 P38 2007 OVERSIZE (YCBA)"

Turner, who often indulged in playful rivalry with his fellow artists, may have been stimulated by Augustus Wall Callcott’s homage to the Dutch Old Masters, “The Pool of London” (Bowood Settlement, Wiltshire), exhibited to acclaim at the Royal Academy in 1816. Described by the “Morning Chronicle” in May 1818 as “one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited,” Dort was immediately acquired by Turner's patron Walter Fawkes. The price was five hundred guineas, a huge sum, though as James Hamilton has recently noted, it is likely that Turner was never paid, since Fawkes was in chronic debt, and Turner had himself lent him three thousand pounds (Hamilton, 2001). The painting hung in the Drawing Room at Farnley Hall until 1966, when it was purchased by Paul Mellon.\\n\\n Although Turner did not visit the Netherlands until he was over forty, he was familiar with important Dutch Old Master paintings in British collections from early in his career, and his first Royal Academy submission, Fishermen at Sea (Tate, London), testifies to his admiration for Rembrandt. Dort pays tribute to one of Turner’s most formative Dutch influences, Aelbert Cuyp; the motif of the packet boat is directly borrowed from Cuyp’s Maas at Dordrecht (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1815. Dort is as much a personal artistic statement as an homage to an Old Master, however; its contrast of cool and warm colors and bright chromatic scale (a contemporary viewer told the diarist Joseph Farington that “it almost puts your eyes out” [Farington, “Diary”, vol. 15, p. 5191]) mark the emergence of Turner the colorist and anticipate the brilliance of his work of the 1820s.\\n\\n Gillian Forrester\\n\\n John Baskett, Paul Mellon's legacy, a passion for British art: masterpieces from the Yale Center for British Art, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, CT, 2007, pp. 30,33,284-85, no. 90, N5220 M552 P38 2007 OVERSIZE (YCBA)"

M.W. Turner made his second Continental tour in 1817 in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars and passed through Dordrecht on his way home. This view, one of Turner’s masterpieces, was painted after his return to London in December 1817 and was exhibited at the Royal Academy in April 1818. The Swan, a packet boat from Rotterdam, is traveling down the river Meuse towards Dordrecht and is being provisioned by passing boats while it is becalmed. A vision of peaceful serenity, the picture contrasted with Turner’s other exhibit that year, a view of the bloody battlefield of Waterloo by moonlight. In Dort, Turner was emulating the celebrated Dutch painter Aelbert Cuyp (1620–1691), whose work was avidly collected by British connoisseurs. The painting’s extraordinary luminosity and brightness of color dazzled the critics, one claiming it was “one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited.” John Constable was probably referring to this picture when, many years later, he remembered it as “the most complete work of genius I ever saw.” --- --- Gallery label for installation of YCBA collection, 2022                       34                       300048722                        Gallery label                                            2022                                                            J.

A vision of peaceful serenity, the picture contrasted with Turner’s other exhibit that year, a view of the bloody battlefield of Waterloo by moonlight. In Dort, Turner was emulating the celebrated Dutch painter Aelbert Cuyp (1620–1691), whose work was avidly collected by British connoisseurs. The painting’s extraordinary luminosity and brightness of color dazzled the critics, one claiming it was “one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited.” John Constable was probably referring to this picture when, many years later, he remembered it as “the most complete work of genius I ever saw.” Dort was bought immediately by Turner’s friend and patron Walter Fawkes and hung in his drawing room at Farnley Hall, his country house in North Yorkshire. --- --- Gallery label for installation of YCBA collection, 2016                       34                       300048722                        Gallery label                                            2016                                                            In summer 1817, Turner visited Dordrecht (sometimes known as Dort) on a tour of the Netherlands.

He spent just a day and a half in Dordrecht (known locally as Dort), making numerous pencil sketches, and exhibited this luminous view of the city from the north at the Royal Academy in 1818. Turner, who often indulged in playful rivalry with his fellow artists, may have been stimulated by Augustus Wall Callcott’s homage to the Dutch Old Masters, “The Pool of London” (Bowood Settlement, Wiltshire), exhibited to acclaim at the Royal Academy in 1816. Described by the “Morning Chronicle” in May 1818 as “one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited,” Dort was immediately acquired by Turner's patron Walter Fawkes. The price was five hundred guineas, a huge sum, though as James Hamilton has recently noted, it is likely that Turner was never paid, since Fawkes was in chronic debt, and Turner had himself lent him three thousand pounds (Hamilton, 2001). The painting hung in the Drawing Room at Farnley Hall until 1966, when it was purchased by Paul Mellon.\\n\\nAlthough Turner did not visit the Netherlands until he was over forty, he was familiar with important Dutch Old Master paintings in British collections from early in his career, and his first Royal Academy submission, Fishermen at Sea (Tate, London), testifies to his admiration for Rembrandt. Dort pays tribute to one of Turner’s most formative Dutch influences, Aelbert Cuyp; the motif of the packet boat is directly borrowed from Cuyp’s Maas at Dordrecht (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1815. Dort is as much a personal artistic statement as an homage to an Old Master, however; its contrast of cool and warm colors and bright chromatic scale (a contemporary viewer told the diarist Joseph Farington that “it almost puts your eyes out” [Farington, “Diary”, vol. 15, p. 5191]) mark the emergence of Turner the colorist and anticipate the brilliance of his work of the 1820s.\\n\\nGillian
